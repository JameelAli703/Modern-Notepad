# Modern-Notepad
This is our third-semester final project of Data Structures & Algorithms, 
prepared by Jameel Ali & Aisha Ali Roll numbers: K-20SW016 & K-
20SW048 Respectively, and we have created a project named “Modern 
Notepad” has some new features such as Background color and themes.

We have used Data Structures like LinkedList & Stack that will be helping 
us to insert, retrieve, delete, save, find & Replace Data, and we used the 
swing library in GUI to add themes and Background colors.
